            <h1>A Quick Intro ...</h1>
            <p id="about">
                In 2000, <b>Babu Vincent </b> decided to step down from a long, meritorious stint as director of a courier company to take the entrepreneurial plunge with Service Square. Since then, he has worked tirelessly and experienced first-hand the company’s growth and evolution – from being a concierge service provider to what it is today.

                He believes in providing experiences rather than just transactions, and strives to give customers the best value. Within Service Square, Babu Vincent is passionate about creating and nurturing a team that values quality, commitment, honesty and above all… precious time.

                As a young man, fresh out of college, Babu Vincent dabbled in teaching, doing social work and working as a business executive. He worked his way up the professional ladder with grit and determination, spending time in different parts of India learning the ways of business, learning the ways of people.

                Babu Vincent has a passion for all things ‘running’: running marathons, running riot on his blog (check out his personal blog: Soulful Growing), running wild in the Kerala rains… and running the extra mile to ensure that you, the customer, have the home of your dreams.
                Your home or workspace is a sacred sanctuary in which you can… just be. But, not if the space is weighed down by the dust and smells of the time. No one feels at home and welcomed in a space that screams for care and attention.

                Enter Service Square, a company that provides professional solutions to make your homes soulful. We believe, and our customers agree, that what makes us special is the ‘heart’ we put into whatever we do. This is why our tagline is, “Service with a heart.” Providing service with full involvement and commitment.
                
                Service Square specializes in providing deep cleaning, floor polishing as well as sofa and carpet cleaning services – for homes, offices, educational institutions, restaurants and large apartment complexes, among others. The company has also recently entered the domains of interior decoration/home renovation and painting services under the banner of Interiors Square.
                
                In many ways, we are a company moulded by our customers. So this “About Us” section is as much about them as it is about us. We have evolved to be the best known for quality and reliability because we listen to them with care and are inspired by what they tell us about their expectations.
                
                That is how we have introduced best global practices into our cleaning services.
                And have become the best-known cleaning service in Chennai. We are very excited about the path we have chosen and would be delighted to help your living/workspace live up to its full potential. </p>
